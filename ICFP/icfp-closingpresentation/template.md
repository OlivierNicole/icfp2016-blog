This is the template for you to liveblog about the talk,
which is at [ICFP](http://conf.researchr.org/track/icfp-2016/icfp-2016-papers)2016 on Wednesday 21st 1755-1810 PM.  You can replace all of this text
with your notes about the talk!

Some useful things to record in a liveblog are:
* the general flow of the speaker's explanation
* background summaries or links that would be useful to a reader
  that has not read the paper.
* any questions the audience asks which may not be recorded correctly
* the URL to the paper, which could be found on the [ICFP preprint](https://github.com/gasche/icfp2016-papers) repo.

There are a couple of ways to contribute your text to the ICFP 2016 liveblog.
First check GitHub [issue #88](https://github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog/issue/88) and
add a note that you are blogging to let other people know.

If you are familiar with the [Git](http://git-scm.com) CLI, then:
* git clone <https://github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog.git>
* copy this template into `icfp2016-blog/ICFP/icfp-closingpresentation/<your-userid>.md` where you can record your notes.
* You can push this file regularly or issue a pull request at your own pace.

If you prefer a web UI:
* navigate [to the GitHub for this talk](https://github.com/ocamllabs/icfp2016-blog/tree/master/ICFP/icfp-closingpresentation)
* click on *Create a New Page* and name it `<your-github-user>.md`
* place the header below at the top of the file, and then add your notes.
